# Advent of Code

This repository houses my solutions for each year's Advent of Code.

I refine the solutions after submission, so if you want to see the state of the code right after I submit the answer, check the commit history and look for "finished part 1" and "finished part 2" commit messages. These commits show the state right after submission, usually.

All solutions written by yours truly, no AI/LLM assistance used.

## FAQ

### Q: I don't want spoilers. / I'm attempting AoC.

Avoid looking at the `main.rs` and `test.rs` files as they contain the solution code and puzzle answers, respectively.
