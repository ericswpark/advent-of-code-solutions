# Advent of Code

This repository houses my solutions for each year's Advent of Code.

(Note: I never finish my code to get in the leaderboards, so there's no need to stagger the code release. Also, the code quality is bad – so if you're thinking about using the solution code here, _don't_. There's a ton more better solutions on the actual subreddit.)
